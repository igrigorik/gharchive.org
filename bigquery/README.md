# Google BigQuery + GH Archive

The entire GH Archive is available as a public dataset on [Google BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/): the dataset is automatically updated every hour and enables you to run arbitrary SQL-like queries over the entire dataset in seconds - i.e. no need to download or process any data on your own.

For instructions on how to get started see: www.gharchive.org/#bigquery
